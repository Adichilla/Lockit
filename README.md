# Lockit
Lockit is based on Android Application for lock your phone without clicking your lock button. From most of the user having problem with lock button damage after many days of use.
According to reasearch Android users nearly use 50 times lock and unlock their phone daily this cause severe damage to lock button.
so I decided to develop an app for the same.
